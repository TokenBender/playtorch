    "3. **Functionality**: NumPy provides a vast library of mathematical functions and operations that are optimized for use with NumPy arrays. Python lists lack these built-in functionalities.\n",
    "4. **Multidimensional Support**: NumPy arrays can be multidimensional, while Python lists are inherently one-dimensional. However, you can create a list of lists to simulate multidimensionality in Python lists.\n",
