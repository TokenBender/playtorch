    "2. **Performance**: NumPy arrays are more efficient in terms of both speed and memory usage. This is because NumPy arrays are implemented in C, which allows for faster computations.\n",
    "3. **Functionality**: NumPy provides a vast library of mathematical functions and operations that are optimized for use with NumPy arrays. Python lists lack these built-in functionalities.\n",

    "1. **Incorrect Data Type**: Ensure that all elements in a NumPy array are of the same type. Mixing types can lead to errors.\n",
    "2. **Shape Mismatch**: When performing operations between arrays, ensure that their shapes are compatible. Use `reshape` or `transpose` if necessary.\n",
    "3. **Indexing Errors**: Be careful with indexing. Python uses 0-based indexing, and negative indices can be used to access elements from the end of the array.\n",
    "4. **Memory Issues**: Large arrays can consume a lot of memory. Use functions like `np.zeros` or `np.ones` to initialize arrays instead of creating them with large literal values.\n",
