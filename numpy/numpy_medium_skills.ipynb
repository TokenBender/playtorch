    "## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Broadcasting Errors**: Ensure that the shapes of the arrays are compatible for broadcasting. If not, reshape the arrays appropriately.\n",
    "2. **Indexing Errors**: Be careful with indexing. Python uses 0-based indexing, and negative indices can be used to access elements from the end of the array.\n",
    "3. **Data Type Errors**: Ensure that all elements in a NumPy array are of the same type. Mixing types can lead to errors.\n",
    "4. **Performance Pitfalls**: Avoid using Python loops for operations on NumPy arrays. Instead, use vectorized operations provided by NumPy for better performance."
