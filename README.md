## Getting Started

To get started, open the files in your preferred environment. For Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files), you'll need Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. For Python scripts (`.py` files), any Python IDE or text editor will work.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for `.ipynb` files)

## Installation

1. Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Install NumPy and PyTorch using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy torch
```

3. (Optional) Install Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab
```
