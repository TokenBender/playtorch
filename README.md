# NumPy and PyTorch Tutorials Repository

This repository contains a collection of tutorials focusing on NumPy and PyTorch, two essential libraries in the Python ecosystem for numerical computations and deep learning. The tutorials are designed to help users understand the fundamental and advanced concepts of these libraries through practical examples and detailed explanations.

## Table of Contents

1. [NumPy Basics](#numpy-basics)
2. [NumPy Medium Skills](#numpy-medium-skills)
3. [PyTorch Basics](#pytorch-basics)

### NumPy Basics

- **Description**: This section covers the fundamental concepts of NumPy, including array creation, array attributes, array operations, mathematical functions, and array manipulation.
- **File**: `numpy_basics.ipynb`

### NumPy Medium Skills

- **Description**: Building on the basics, this section explores more advanced NumPy concepts such as broadcasting, universal functions (ufuncs), and advanced indexing.
- **File**: `numpy_medium_skills.ipynb`

### PyTorch Basics

- **Description**: This section introduces the basics of PyTorch, including tensor operations, creating a simple neural network, and training the network.
- **File**: `pytorch_basics.py`

## Getting Started

To get started with the tutorials, clone the repository and open the respective files in your preferred environment. For Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files), you will need Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed. For Python scripts (`.py` files), any Python IDE or text editor will suffice.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url.git
cd your-repo-directory
```

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for `.ipynb` files)

## Installation

1. Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Install NumPy and PyTorch using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy torch
```

3. (Optional) Install Jupyter Notebook:
