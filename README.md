### NumPy Basics

- **Description**: This section covers the fundamental concepts of NumPy, including array creation, array attributes, array operations, mathematical functions, and array manipulation.
- **File**: `numpy_basics.ipynb`

### NumPy Medium Skills

- **Description**: Building on the basics, this section explores more advanced NumPy concepts such as broadcasting, universal functions (ufuncs), and advanced indexing.
- **File**: `numpy_medium_skills.ipynb`

### PyTorch Basics

- **Description**: This section introduces the basics of PyTorch, including tensor operations, creating a simple neural network, and training the network.
- **File**: `pytorch_basics.py`

## Getting Started

To get started with the tutorials, open the respective files in your preferred environment. For Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files), you will need Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed. For Python scripts (`.py` files), any Python IDE or text editor will suffice.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for `.ipynb` files)

## Installation

1. Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Install NumPy and PyTorch using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy torch
```

3. (Optional) Install Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab
```
